### Concentration game

Description

This is the Project0 for my GA Web Development Imersive course. The task was to create a game using javascript programming.

Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

We will continue with the rest of the boxes.
